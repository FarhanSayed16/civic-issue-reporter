### ## üìù Revised Project `README.md` File

Here is a complete, revised `README.md` file that you can use for your project. It incorporates the more powerful API blueprint.

# Civic Issue Backend

A comprehensive FastAPI-based backend for a crowdsourced civic issue reporting and resolution system, designed for high-impact hackathon demonstration.

## Features

-   **JWT Authentication**: Secure user login for both citizens and administrators.
-   **Full Issue Management**: A complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) workflow for civic issues.
-   **Admin Dashboard Support**: Advanced filtering, sorting, and management endpoints for the municipal operations portal.
-   **Crowdsourcing**: Citizens can upvote existing issues to help prioritize them.
-   **Data Analytics**: Endpoints to provide KPI statistics and data for heatmap visualizations.
-   **Real-time Updates**: WebSockets for instantly notifying citizens of status changes.
-   **Scalable Media Uploads**: A two-step process using presigned URLs for direct-to-storage uploads.
-   **Background Tasks**: Celery workers ready for tasks like notifications and media processing.

## API Endpoint Blueprint

*(This is the full list from the section above, included here for completeness)*

#### Authentication
- `POST /auth/register` - Register a new citizen user.
- `POST /auth/login` - Authenticate a user (citizen or admin).

#### Users (Citizen-Facing)
- `GET /users/me` - Get the profile of the currently logged-in user.
- `GET /users/me/issues` - Get a list of all issues submitted by the current user.

#### Issues (Citizen-Facing)
- `POST /issues/initiate-upload` - Get a secure URL for a direct media upload.
- `POST /issues` - Submit the issue metadata after the media has been uploaded.
- `GET /issues` - Get a list of nearby, public issues.
- `GET /issues/{issue_id}` - Get detailed information for a single issue.
- `POST /issues/{issue_id}/upvote` - Upvote an existing issue.

#### Admin / Operations
- `GET /admin/issues` - Get all issues with filtering (by status, ward, category).
- `PATCH /admin/issues/{issue_id}` - Update an issue's status, assignment, or notes.
- `DELETE /admin/issues/{issue_id}` - Delete a spam or invalid report.
- `GET /admin/users` - Get a list of all users.

#### Analytics
- `GET /analytics/stats` - Get key KPI numbers for the dashboard.
- `GET /analytics/heatmap` - Get all issue coordinates for the heatmap.

#### Real-time Updates
- `WS /ws/updates/{user_id}` - WebSocket for live status updates.

## Next Steps

1.  **Implement SQLAlchemy models** in `app/models/` for all necessary tables (users, issues, etc.).
2.  **Set up database migrations** with Alembic.
3.  **Build out each endpoint** in the `app/api/` routers, connecting them to the business logic in `app/services/`.
4.  **Configure Celery and Redis** to handle background notifications.
5.  **Set up S3-compatible storage** for media files.

This revised blueprint gives you a much more powerful and complete system to demonstrate to the judges. It tells a complete story from citizen reporting to administrative action and data analysis.
